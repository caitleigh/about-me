            <h1>About me (because I knew you were wondering)....</h1>

            <p>So, you want some idea of what you've gotten yourself into, eh?</p>
            <p>Well, I'll give you a few pertinent highlights, and just to help you work off that vente double mocha frappuchino, there'll be a quiz at the end.</p>
            <p>I was born a poor white child in western Tennessee... (no really, I was). 'Navy brat' says alot, but it goes downhill from there. My family didn't last long enough to see me into school; blew up when I was about four. Extended family had to help my mom out for a while, that brought my younger brother and I up to Washington for about five years while my mom got established in California.  Once she could support us, we moved back down with her and lived in the towns around the periphery of San Jose (back BEFORE it became 'Silicon Valley' - THAT happened while I was away in the service). We moved several times in the years we were there (Military habits? No, it was purely economical.) and I even graduated High School in San Jose.</p>
            <p>I discovered electronics in Junior High School.  Though I didn't pursue it immediately, it made its mark and has influenced me ever since. I used High School as my opportunity to explore every item in the course catalog that I could squeeze into my four years there (including summers, of course) and still didn't get it all in. My best friend back then joined the USMC JROTC program there mid-way through Freshman year and by the beginning of Sophomore year had me in it, too. Consequently, I spent the next three years as a 'Junior Jarhead' and loved it.</p>
            <p>Graduation rolled around all too soon, and with no clear idea of what I wanted to be when I grew up, I ended up in the USAF (the Marines missed out because the recruiter couldn't see past his quotas and offered me a dirt job, with no fall-back plan when I declined). I chose computer repair as my specialty and ended up working on a missile communications system that was designed before I was born! After my first tour (stateside - South Dakota, Baby!), I got out and made my way back to California, where family was. I tried to build a life for my own family just north of Los Angeles, but after three years I jumped at a chance to move back up here and have been here ever since.</p>
            <p>My first job up here was in Point of Sale hardware repair (think 'grocery store checkout equipment' and you're right on the money) and over the 16.5 years I stayed with them, they grew from fourteen people in Gig Harbor to over 80 people on site, with 60 more in a second facility in Louisville, KY and another dozen in a startup branch just outside of Long Beach, CA. While with them, I finished my AS degree and tooke some additional college coursework, exploring programming, computer networks, and business. Then 9/11 happened, the housing bubble burst, the economy slowed down, and my job there ended.</p>
            <p>Once I left that job, I tried a few other things; I worked in a couple of machine shops, did a stint as an inside salesman for a groundwater pump sales company, worked a couple of contractor jobs on the Lewis side of JBLM, and for the past seven years have been back in the POS hardware repair and field support business (where many of my customers LOVE me!  Not sure? Just mention my name at Vashon Thriftway, for example, and see what kind of reaction you get.  Go ahead, I'll wait...).</p>
            <p>Through an ironic chain of events, as I was contemplating a new career path, I was pushed into a path that has lead straight to Code Fellows. I did my due diligence before I signed on and I liked what I saw (compared to the competition), so here I am, intent upon becoming 'Professional-grade!'</p>
            <p>So, how was that for a sip from a fire hydrant? Ready for the quiz I promised you?</p>
